# TheatreJS

[To be] a timeline-based animation editor for the web:

## Demo

 Take a look at [this page](http://gelobi.org/griddify) if you wanna see a demo. It's our first attempt to use TheatreJS in a real-world project!
 
 **Note**: Please make sure you're not confusing this project with [TheaterJS](https://github.com/Zhouzi/TheaterJS)

## When will it release?

**This is a work-in-progress** and we're actively working on getting it ready for public release, so please stay tuned :)

Right now we have to partially replace two modules (~~the timeline data saver~~ (done) and the ui) and refactor some of the code into separate components. Then `0.2` will be officially ready and we'll post installation instructions and tutorials.

#### Looking for `0.1`?

`0.1` was not a public release, but some of our demos depend on it, so we keep it in a separate [branch](https://github.com/AriaMinaei/theatrejs/tree/0.1).

## License

TheatreJS will be free and open-source. We're discussing which open-source licensing model to choose, and whether to include a commercial license.
