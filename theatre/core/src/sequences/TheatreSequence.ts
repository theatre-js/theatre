  /**
   * Attaches an audio source to the sequence. Playing the sequence automatically

   *
   * @returns A promise that resolves once the audio source is loaded and decoded
   *
   * Learn more [here](https://docs.theatrejs.com/in-depth/#sequence-attachaudio).
   *
   * @example
   * Usage:
   * ```ts
   * // Loads and decodes audio from the URL and then attaches it to the sequence
   * await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({source: "https://localhost:3000/audio.mp3"})
   * sheet.sequence.play()
   *
   * // Providing your own AudioAPI Context, destination, etc
   * const audioContext: AudioContext = {...} // create an AudioContext using the Audio API
   * const audioBuffer: AudioBuffer = {...} // create an AudioBuffer
   * const destinationNode = audioContext.destination
   *
   * await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({source: audioBuffer, audioContext, destinationNode})
   * ```
   *
   * Note: It's better to provide the `audioContext` rather than allow Theatre.js to create it.
   * That's because some browsers [suspend the audioContext](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#webaudio)
   * unless it's initiated by a user gesture, like a click. If that happens, Theatre.js will
   * wait for a user gesture to resume the audioContext. But that's probably not an
   * optimal user experience. It is better to provide a button or some other UI element
   * to communicate to the user that they have to initiate the animation.
   *
   * @example
   * Example:
   * ```ts
   * // html: <button id="#start">start</button>
   * const button = document.getElementById('start')
   *
   * button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
   *   const audioContext = ...
   *   await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({audioContext, source: '...'})
   *   sheet.sequence.play()
   * })
